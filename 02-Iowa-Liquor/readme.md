Project 2: Liquor Sales + Linear Regression

### Overview
The state of Iowa provides many data sets on their website, including [this dataset](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/pf5n5sgfgiri3i8/AACkaMeL_i_WgZ00rpxOOcysa?dl=0) which contains transactions for all stores that have a class E liquor license.

NOTE: Since dataset is too big to run the python code on. I use [this 10% dataset version of Iowa liquor sales](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx2SHQGVqWaseDB4QU9ZSVFDY2M/view?usp=sharing).

### Scenario: State tax board

You are a data scientist in residence at the Iowa State tax board. The Iowa State legislature is considering changes in the liquor tax rates and wants a report of current liquor sales by county and projections for the rest of the year.

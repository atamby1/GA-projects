Project 5: Predicting Terrorism / Bayesian Inference

## About the Dataset

From Kaggle:
> The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2015 (with annual updates planned for the future). The GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 150,000 cases. The database is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the [University of Maryland](http://start.umd.edu/gtd/). 

> Geography: Worldwide

> Time period: 1970-2015, except 1993 (2016 in progress, publication expected June 2017)

> Unit of analysis: Attack

> Variables: >100 variables on location, tactics, perpetrators, targets, and outcomes

> Sources: Unclassified media articles (Note: Please interpret changes over time with caution. Global patterns are driven by diverse trends in particular regions, and data collection is influenced by fluctuations in access to media coverage over both time and place.)

> Definition of terrorism:

> "The threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation."

You will need to make use of the [codebook](http://start.umd.edu/gtd/downloads/Codebook.pdf) that functions as a data dictionary.

Moreover, this [2007 paper by LaFree (UMD)](https://ccjs.umd.edu/sites/ccjs.umd.edu/files/pubs/FTPV_A_224594.pdf) introduces the dataset very well.

You must download the 28MB zip file, unzip it, and work with the 128MB csv on your machine.

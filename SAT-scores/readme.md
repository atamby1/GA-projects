# Project 1: SAT Scores + Summary Statistics

### Overview

For the first project, I’m going to take a look at SAT scores around the United States. I’ll be exploring this data to see what I can learn using descriptive statistics skills and visualizations.

**Goal**: A Jupyter notebook that describes your data with visualizations & statistical analysis.

In this project, I:

- Describe the data
- Perform methods of exploratory data analysis, including:
  - Use Matplotlib & Tableau to create visualizations
  - Use NumPy to apply basic summary statistics: mean, median, mode
- Determine if the dataset appears to follow a normal distribution
